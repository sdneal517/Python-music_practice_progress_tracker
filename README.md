# Music Practice Progress Tracker

**Introduction**

This Python program helps you track progress while rehearsing a musical section. It uses a coin-based system to encourage consecutive accurate run-throughs and gradually increase the tempo.

**How It Works**

- Start with 5 coins, all showing 'heads.'
- Set your initial tempo and tempo increase.
- Aim for 5 consecutive accurate run-throughs.
- If successful, the tempo increases; otherwise, coins reset.

**Requirements**

- Musical instrument
- Metronome
- Knowledge of your initial tempo

**Getting Started**

1. Run the Python program.
2. Enter your starting tempo and tempo increase.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

**How to Use**

- Track your coin status (heads/tails).
- Indicate if you played the section correctly.
- Achieve 5 consecutive 'tails' to increase the tempo.

- Aim for 5 consecutive 'tails' to increase tempo.
- Gradually challenge yourself to improve accuracy and speed.
